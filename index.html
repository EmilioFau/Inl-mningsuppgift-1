                    highlight some fun and
                    somewhat stupid interactions to try in casual, unranked pubs.</span>

                    position four and five supports can have on the
                    game extends far beyond the laning stage and far beyond simple saves and disables. There are some
                    supports, however, who
                    really don’t fit into the current meta and could really use a buff or two.</span>

                <span class="blog-text">There are very few overpowered heroes in the current patch: outside of pro-scene
                    Chen, the current patch is very well
                    balanced. That said we feel some heroes are quite heavily underpowered and as a result they are not
                    played
                    professionally and have limited usefulness in pubs. So today we are going to discuss heroes who
                    desperately need a buff.</span>
